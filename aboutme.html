<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span>
I am fond of video games, I love playing a good competitive game with a close group of friends that really push our ability to coordinate as a team. I also always enjoy a good turn based tactical game or games with an immersive story. Apart from these I love listening to audiobooks and podcasts, boardgames, playing tennis, soccer and hiking. I am eager to meet new people, to connect, discuss, network and grow.
