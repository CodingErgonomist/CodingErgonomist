<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="about-text">
Triangle 180 is a connect-3 puzzle game that is easy learn but hard to master. It has two game modes, one being a limited time challenge to get as high of a score as possible and requires quick reflexes and pattern recognition. The second involves solving a puzzle by connecting triangles in the correct order to clear all the dots.
