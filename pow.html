<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="about-text">
Parity of War is meant to find a harmony between fast and dynamic MOBA combat and real time strategy. Combat is highly interactive with many layers of choices hinging on the actions of both allies and enemies.
It is my first project I have worked on on my game dev journey and stands as a solid proof of concept for what could be a new genre of MOBAs. 
</p>
  
<h2>Role</h2>
<p class="about-text">
I worked on Parity of War as a solo developer using Unity and Photon for Networking. I built the game systems using a visual scripting language called plyblox as my first foray into coding. Over the lifetime of the project I have since moved to coding new systems in C#.
  The design of the game is inspired by the Guild Wars 2 combat system with character design focusing more on player interaction and providing opportunity to react to opponents actions. The added layer of a commander also helps ease some of the tactical burden on players with such an involved skill system.
  I had recruited a 2 contract artists to help with character designs and animation.

<h2>Game Mode</h2>
<ul>
Conquest is a 6v6 battlefield. Each team has an outpost with a number of defensive structures. The objective is to destroy the other teams outpost. Golems will continuously spawn to try and attack the enemy outpost. 
Each team has one Commander who directs the teams resources in an RTS fasion, building and upgrading their army and providing tactical support. The other 5 team members are Elect, powerful fighters who can level up over the course of the game.
