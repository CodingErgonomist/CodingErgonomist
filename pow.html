<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="about-text">
Parity of War is meant to find a harmony between fast and dynamic MOBA combat and real time strategy. Combat is highly interactive with many layers of choices hinging on the actions of both allies and enemies.
</p>
  
<h2>Development</h2>
<p class="about-text">
  Parity of War was my first project on my game dev journey and stands as a solid proof of concept for what could be a new genre of MOBAs. 
  I worked on Parity of War as a solo developer using Unity and Photon for Networking with some help from One Man Army Games for the character models and animations. I built the game systems using a visual scripting language called plyblox as my first foray into coding. Over the lifetime of the project I have since moved to coding new systems in C#.
  The game presented many unique challenges being an extremely ambitious project but through much dedication has turned into a fun prototype, demonstrating what can be accomplished.<br><br>
  The design of the game is inspired by the Guild Wars 2 combat system with character design focusing more on player interaction and providing opportunity to react to opponents actions. The added layer of a commander also helps ease some of the tactical burden on players with such an involved skill system.

<h2>Game Mode</h2>
<p class="about-text"><ul>
Conquest is a 6v6 battlefield. Each team has an outpost with a number of defensive structures. The objective is to destroy the other teams outpost. Golems will continuously spawn to try and attack the enemy outpost.<br><br>
Each team has one Commander who directs the teams resources in an RTS fasion, building and upgrading their army and providing tactical support. The other 5 team members are Elect, powerful fighters who can level up over the course of the game.
