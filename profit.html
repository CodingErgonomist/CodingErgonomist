<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="about-text">
Guilds and Profiteers is a persistant social deduction. You own a guild that takes in travelling adventurers on their various quests. Some of those travelers are outlaws looking to take advantage of your hospitality and need to be rooted out before they can harm your reputation and gold stores.
You must figure out who is telling the truth and who is lying and bring justice to the outlaws. Travelers are sent by other players who control their actions and lies to further their own guild's agenda. 
</p>
  
<h2>Development</h2>
<p class="about-text">
Guild and Profiteers is my current project and still in development. It was started in late 2018 and I have worked on it as a solo developer during that time. I am looking to expand the team in order to polish up the game before releasing it for android and IOS. The core gameplay systems are all in place with focus turning to metagame progression and social features. 
The game was built in Unity using a custom Photon Server backend and MongoDB database. The game is asynchronous so players can make choices over a longer game period without stressing server resources.
